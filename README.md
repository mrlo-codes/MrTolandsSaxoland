# Motivation:  
   Ever since Mr. Toland got a Playdate for his birthday, he expressed interest in coding a game for his Playdate and asked me to show him the ropes.
   Interested in the Playdate SDK and not having forayed into Lua (also forgetting to get a gift for his birthday), I started dabbling in the code to learn it myself.
   Then, I had a great idea to make a small proof of concept rhythm game for him as a secret birthday present.
   Now, not so secret anymore *(hence why this repository is public now)*.
    This should be done only once, you need to restart VSCode after this.  



# To-Do List:
0. ~~Have a working intro screen with some animation.~~
1. ~~Create the screen with the staff, notes scrolling, and cursor.~~
2. Have the game screen include Mr. Toland as the sprite playing the saxophone.
4. ~~Have a working game where notes can be hit by a cursor locked to the left staff that can only be moved up and down.~~
5. **Implement the crank movement locked to the cursor.**
6. **Test and tweak the hits so difficulty is acceptable.**
7. Implement the synth so it produces a sax-like sound when notes are hit.
8. Align the synth so the notes play the correct note based on their position on the staff.
9. Change text and shapes into sprites for better memory management.
10. Set a target score or end duration to end the game.
11. Set a target score where enough missess or low score would trigger lose screen.
12. Set a result screen.
